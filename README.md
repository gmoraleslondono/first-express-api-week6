# My React App with Express Server

In this project I am exploring how to build APIs.
This project is a simple React application built with Vite and an Express server.

## Installation
To install the dependencies for both the client and the server, run:

### Install client dependencies
```
cd client
npm install
```
### Install server dependencies
```
cd ../server
npm install
```

## Usage
To start the development server and the client, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:   
```
cd server
npm run start
```
The server will start on http://localhost:8080.

2. Start the client:
```
cd ../client
npm run dev
```
The client will start on http://localhost:5173.

## Scripts

### Client
npm run dev: Starts the development server.
npm run build: Builds the application for production.
npm run serve: Serves the production build.

### Server
npm run start: Starts the Express server.
